# Deployment 101


We looked at ReplicaSets earlier. However, ReplicaSet have one major drawback: 
once you select the pods that are managed by a ReplicaSet, you cannot change their pod templates. 

For example, if you are using a ReplicaSet to deploy four pods with NodeJS running and you want to change the NodeJS image to a newer version, you need to delete the ReplicaSet and recreate it. Restarting the pods causes downtime till the images are available and the pods are running again.

A Deployment resource uses a ReplicaSet to manage the pods. However, it handles updating them in a controlled way. 
Let’s dig deeper into Deployment Controllers and patterns.



## Creating Your First Deployment

The following Deployment definition deploys four pods with nginx as their hosted application:

```
git clone https://github.com/dockerlyon/k8s-workshop/
cd Deployment101
kubectl create -f nginx-dep.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```

## Checking the list of application deployment



To list your deployments use the get deployments command:
```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   2/2     2            2           63s

```

```
[node1 Deployment101]$ kubectl describe deploy
Name:                   nginx-deployment
Namespace:              default

  Containers:
   nginx:
    Image:        nginx:1.7.9
    Port:         80/TCP
    Host Port:    0/TCP
    Environment:  <none>
    Mounts:       <none>
  Volumes:        <none>
Conditions:
  Type           Status  Reason

OldReplicaSets:  <none>
NewReplicaSet:   nginx-deployment-6dd86d77d (2/2 replicas created)
Events:

  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  90s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-6dd86d77d to 2
```

We should have 1 Pod. If not, run the command again. This shows:

    The DESIRED state is showing the configured number of replicas
    The CURRENT state show how many replicas are running now
    The UP-TO-DATE is the number of replicas that were updated to match the desired (configured) state
    The AVAILABLE state shows how many replicas are actually AVAILABLE to the users

```
[node1 Deployment101]$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   2/2     2            2           2m57s
```

```
[node1 Deployment101]$ kubectl get po
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-6dd86d77d-84fwp   1/1     Running   0          3m44s
nginx-deployment-6dd86d77d-xnrqp   1/1     Running   0          3m44s
```

## Step #2. Scale up/down application deployment

Now let’s scale the Deployment to 4 replicas. We are going to use the kubectl scale command,
followed by the deployment type, name and desired number of instances:
```
Biradars-MacBook-Air-4:~ sangam$ kubectl scale deployments/nginx-deployment --replicas=4
deployment.extensions/nginx-deployment scaled
```

The change was applied, and we have 4 instances of the application available. Next, 
let’s check if the number of Pods changed:


Now There should be 4 pods running in the cluster
```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   4/4     4            4           4m

```

There are 4 Pods now, with different IP addresses. The change was registered in the Deployment events log. To check that, use the describe command:

```
$ kubectl describe deployments/nginx-deployment
Name:                   nginx-deployment
Namespace:              default
CreationTimestamp:      Sat, 30 Nov 2019 20:04:34 +0530

Biradars-MacBook-Air-4:~ sangam$ 
```



```
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE             NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

Biradars-MacBook-Air-4:~ sangam$ 
```


You can also view in the output of this command that there are 4 replicas now.


# Scaling the service to 2 Replicas 

To scale down the Service to 2 replicas, run again the scale command:

```
$ kubectl scale deployments/nginx-deployment --replicas=2
deployment.extensions/nginx-deployment scaled
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   2/2     2            2           7m23s
Biradars-MacBook-Air-4:~ sangam$ 
```



## Step #3. Perform rolling updates to application deployment

So far, everything our Deployment did is no different than a typical ReplicaSet. The real power of a Deployment lies in its ability to update the pod templates without causing application outage.

Let’s say that you have finished testing the nginx 1.7.9 , and you are ready to use it in production. The current pods are using the older nginx version . The following command changes the deployment pod template to use the new image:

To update the image of the application to new version, use the set image command,
followed by the deployment name and the new image version:

```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   2/2     2            2           7m23s

The command notified the Deployment to use a different image for your app and initiated a rolling update. Check the status of the new Pods, and view the old one terminating with the get pods command:

## Step #4. Rollback updates to application deployment


The rollout command reverted the deployment to the previous known state. Updates are versioned and you can revert to any previously know state of a Deployment. List again the Pods:

```
$ kubectl rollout undo deployments/nginx-deployment
deployment.extensions/nginx-deployment rolled back

$ kubectl rollout status deployments/nginx-deployment 
deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out

```

After the rollout succeeds, you may want to get the Deployment.

The output shows the update progress until all the pods use the new container image.

The algorithm that Kubernetes Deployments use when deciding how to roll updates is to keep at least 25% of the pods running. Accordingly, it doesn’t kill old pods unless a sufficient number of new ones are up. In the same sense, it does not create new pods until enough pods are no longer running. Through this algorithm, the application is always available during updates.

You can use the following command to determine the update strategy that the Deployment is using:
```
Biradars-MacBook-Air-4:~ sangam$ kubectl describe deployments | grep Strategy
StrategyType:           RollingUpdate
RollingUpdateStrategy:  25% max unavailable, 25% max surge
Biradars-MacBook-Air-4:~ sangam$ 
```


## Step #5. Cleanup

Finally you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:
```
kubectl delete service nginx-deployment
kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
```
