# Setting up WeaveScope for visualizing Kubernetes Pods, Services, Containers & Hosts

## Pre-requisite

- Docker for Mac OR
- PWK 


## Installing WeaveScope

```
kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/scope.yaml?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

This downloads a recent Scope image from Dockerhub and launches a probe onto every node as well as a single Scope app. Once launched, Scope doesnâ€™t require any other configuration.

Allowable parameters for the launcher URL:

```
v - Weave Scope version or tag, e.g. latest current release is the default
k8s-service-type - Kubernetes service type (for running Scope in Standalone mode), can be either LoadBalancer or NodePort, by default this is unspecified (only internal access)
Since we are trying to access it via play with kubernetes or Katakoda platform we need to change the service from ClusterIp to NodePort for that run the following command.
```
```
kubectl get svc -n weave -o yaml > svc.yaml && sed -i "s/ClusterIP/NodePort/g" svc.yaml && kubectl replace -f svc.yaml
```

## Open Scope in Your Browser

```
From the kubectl get svc -n weave take the Nodeport and hit open PWK on that port 
```

Now get ready to access via  NodePort(31741 in this case).
